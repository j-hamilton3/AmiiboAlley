  <h2 class="title is-5">Amiibo Data</h2>
  <p>
    The data for this project is concerning currently released “Amiibo” figurines. These are NFC figurines created by the gaming company Nintendo; each Amiibo is based on a Nintendo or 3rd party character. <br><br>
    The data I used for this project is retrieved from the Amiibo API (<a href='https://amiiboapi.com/'>https://amiiboapi.com/</a>). The Amiibo API contains information regarding all currently released Amiibo figurines and is maintained by a developer named Nevin Nu.<br><br>
    I pulled data from multiple different endpoints of the API, each concerning an Amiibo Series or Game Series. I tried to mostly avoid adding Amiibo’s from 3rd party franchises, and only pulled in Amiibo’s that are in figurine form (no Amiibo cards).<br><br>
  </p>
  <h2 class="title is-5">Data Structure</h2>
  <p>
   The following Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) describes the structure of the data stored within the application.
   The first four tables, Amiibos, AmiiboSeries, GameSeries and Characters store data related to the Amiibo products and their related series.
   The next four tables, Customers, Provinces, Orders, and OrderAmiibos, store information regarding Amiibo Alley customers and the orders they place.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold">Amiibo Data</h3>
  <br>
  <p>
     The Amiibos table is the focal point of the structure; each Amiibo is part of exactly one AmiiboSeries and GameSeries and is associated with exactly one character.
     A GameSeries, and Character can have zero to many Amiibos, while an AmiiboSeries can have one to many Amiibos associated with it.
     Each Amiibo has an associated name, release date and price.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold">Customer/Order Data</h3>
  <br>
  <p>
    The Customers table stores data regarding Amiibo Alley customers; details like full name, city, postal code, province, and username and password for login purposes are stored.
    This table is associated with a Provinces table by foreign key, that contains all province names in Canada.
    The Orders table stores information regarding orders placed by Customers.
    To resolve the many to many relationships between the Orders and Amiibos tables, the OrderAmiibos table was created.
    This table stores information including quantity of Amiibos ordered, and the unit price at the time (to solve the time anomaly).
    This ensures that customers can place orders of multiple different Amiibos and order a specific quantity of products.
